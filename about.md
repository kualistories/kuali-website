title: What is Kuali?
permalink: /about/
---

We are a group of three university students eager to explore the world! However, we realised we wouldn’t be able to cover all the ground by ourselves, hence we decided to interview people and share how they saw the world instead! 

<h2>Kuali is a place for stories from and about Malaysians.</h2>

Despite our common origins, Malaysians are blessed with extraordinary diversity - from the places where we study, the paths we have chosen and the projects we’ve thrown ourselves into, to the friends we’ve surrounded ourselves with! Good or bad, these experiences serve to define us and the worlds we live in. But oftentimes, we find security amongst people of our own “type” and are hesitant to explore beyond the realms of familiarity. 

We hope to bring together stories that showcase the different paths we Malaysians have collectively taken. By sharing stories, we are building bridges and connecting to one another better. And if we could gather enough stories from people of different worlds? Who knows, beyond understanding our differences, we just might understand that we are not that different after all.
