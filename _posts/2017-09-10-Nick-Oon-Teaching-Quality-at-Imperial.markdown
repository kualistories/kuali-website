In the academic field, rankings aren’t exactly synonymous with teaching quality. Imperial is amazing in terms of rankings, but in my opinion, the high rank comes mainly from the research and some of the teaching is honestly a bit subpar. 

I don’t expect spoon-feeding, after all, it is the student’s responsibility to learn; I just think that certain members of the teaching staff could spend more energy connecting with students and presenting their knowledge with more passion. In my course, some of the students do indeed complain about the lecturers, and it’s not just a particular subset or even Malaysian mindset but it’s sort of agreed that we could have better teachers. 

Their motivations for teaching are quite varied I’m sure, and I’m sure that a few of them likely wouldn’t even go into teaching if they were given a choice. In retrospect, I definitely gave a lot of educators some flak they didn’t deserve.
