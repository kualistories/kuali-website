      This article first emerged as part of a larger conversation we had with Nicholas Oon. 
      Read the full interview <a href="/2017/09/10/Conversations-with-Nick-Oon">here</a>!

    <p>It really does not matter which university you go to, it’s the extracurricular activities and the people you meet with that determines the worth of your time spent there. The course is merely a channel to feed you information; I believe exams do not really teach me anything as its main role is to make me take the course seriously and connect people to the course.</p>

<p><img src="https://kualistories.github.io/img/Network.jpg" alt="Network" /></p>

<p>You could go to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) or to Oxford or Cambridge but if you end up disinterested in the course while simultaneously not trying any new activities, you will only end up achieving less than if you had gone to a lesser-ranked uni and taken part in lots of extracurricular activities to broaden your horizons.</p>

<p>Let’s say you are connected with two friends:</p>

<p>One is a very creative and proactive person; he really pushes himself to create things and has his own network of ‘makers’; by being friends with him you get the opportunity to hear about awesome things his friends are making and maybe even learn something new!</p>

<p>Another friend is a very friendly, outgoing person who volunteers a lot in her spare time. She likely has a network of contacts throughout say, education due to her experience volunteering there, and by being friends with her you also get access to her contacts in case you want to enter the field in the future.</p>

<p>Ultimately for me, I have no regrets coming to London due to the network I have built up.</p>
