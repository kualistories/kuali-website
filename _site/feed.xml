        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you say to your pre-uni self?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing I’d say is that the dynamics of university are very different from high school. In high school or college, there was a defined set of targets and expectations put forward by others, for instance scoring well in school exams, looking for scholarship opportunities, entering a good university etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In university, you are on your own. You are responsible for every decision you make and every decision you make might decide who you are and what you do in the very near future. One major difference I noticed lies in the absence of short-term goals like what you would have during high school. You know you have to do something but what? How? I felt lost and perhaps depressed, to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my second and third year, I started a few projects as well as some business endeavors. It was a tremendously exhausting journey but surprisingly I felt much better than I was in first year.  I found a path and a purpose, though it might not be the easiest path to walk on. I might trip or fall a lot but even if I do, I am moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might say university is “useless” because in many cases, what you study will probably have nothing to do with what you do in the future. Personally, I think that university is the perfect ground for you to build connections with amazing people all around the world, and the perfect ground to fail. Yes, fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;University is the perfect ground for you to build connections with amazing people all around the world, and the perfect ground to fail. Yes, fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a university student, you do not have as many responsibilities and expectations than you would have as a working adult but you have more freedom and help. You can afford to fail and start over - an inevitable yet crucial process that builds you up to your eventual success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, you have an easy access to a network of professionals literally right at your doorstep! Professors and lecturers are generally always willing to help you if they can with free advice if you go up to them for a chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And what was university like for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first entered university, I actually felt that the language and culture barrier was a factor that hindered social mingling, which was quite surprising to me. I assumed that it would go okay but I found it a bit challenging to mingle with the locals. To be frank, I found the local accent quite hard to understand; I connected better with international students and we knew how each other felt, since we were all trying our best to communicate and learn together. Due to the language and cultural barriers, I struggled a little in making deeper connections with people even though I had no problem doing so back in Malaysia, but it did get better eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously I also felt lost as I was questioning what was the point of studying so hard in university. “What’s the next step?” I wondered, especially since I could see the end of university coming soon, and with that, there was a need to “step into society” and do something worthwhile as a career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my second and third year, I felt a lot more comfortable. I eventually started some projects and a business of my own, which was quite ironic as I used to hate business. The financial pressure as a result of my business, the amount of workload from both study and work as well as personal health issues made me feel quite down in the dumps at a certain point. Some would say “depressed” although I’m not really sure if the symptoms fit. However, this was the path I chose and I never regretted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you elaborate more on the “depression” aspect?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that I noticed in Imperial is that depressed people tend to be quite evasive regarding their issues and are reluctant to admit they’re in trouble. In particular, people don’t want others to pity them and that contributes to the idea that depression is ‘taboo’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, from what I’ve seen, &lt;em&gt;a lot of Imperial students suffer from it&lt;/em&gt;; what matters is how you handle it. People are often more than willing to help you, they do have similar feelings and can give you mental support if you need it. So don’t be afraid to voice out if you need help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when you do open up to someone else, they might not take it seriously as they don’t see the depth of how affected you are by it due to the mask that you put on daily, and the fact that you seem so ‘normal’. If you don’t feel comfortable talking with friends who may not know how to respond, Imperial health services do offer good professional counseling to those who need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Malaysian scholars, in particular, have very high expectations of themselves and being at a top university doesn’t really help matters! Here you’re surrounded by top-tier talent from all around the world, so if you fail at anything it hits you really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d say to always prepare yourself for failure; things don’t always turn out the way you want them to and that’s alright, you shouldn’t beat yourself up over it. Learn and salvage as much as possible from your mistake. Don’t dwell on it, work on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;editors-note&quot;&gt;Editor’s Note: Depression is a serious and complicated illness, and we would like to point out that depression can take many forms; experiences and symptoms stated here might differ with the experience of others that are experiencing depression, and the coping mechanisms that may work for one may not work as well for another person.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you elaborate more on the business that you started? I think it’d be helpful to give readers a glimpse of what is possible for them to accomplish even while they are at university.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started a social enterprise with my business partner in Malaysia and recruited a few of my friends to join the team. The essence of a social entrepreneurship is building a business that gives back to the community, which I personally feel quite strongly about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very rough in the beginning, especially when looking for investments or partnerships, as no one wants to support a company with no proven track record. When you have no experience and no capital to do stuff, you need to get them yourself. You need to build the experience and if it is possible, use that experience to build your capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you have no experience and no capital to do stuff, you need to get them yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my entire three years at university, I never traveled outside of London - except Brighton and Malaysia, if that counts! Instead, I spent my time building new skills. From scratch, I studied graphic design, digital marketing, and business, realms that I never ventured into before and never thought I would prior to my startup project. After a while, I started marketing my skills to international clients via various online platforms and begin building my client base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that period, I slept only 5 hours a day and had a ton of caffeine - not really advisable for a uni student! Nevertheless, I survived, and although the project didn’t manage to launch in the end (we put it on hold as we weren’t satisfied with the final quality of the products), we definitely learned a lot from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have just launched another company with my partner, offering digital services to both local and international clients.  We hope that through this company we could eventually build up a core team that we trust as well as sufficient capital so that we could revisit our initial idea in the very near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow, that sounds great! Nice to hear from you, Wee Rock, and thank you for your time!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Relentless optimism</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: You seem to be a pretty optimistic person. Have you always been like this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the years, I’ve had so many people tell me that I &lt;em&gt;dream too big&lt;/em&gt;, or that I &lt;em&gt;am too naive&lt;/em&gt;. It always annoyed me when they said that, because for all their concern, the only thing I hear when they say that is &lt;em&gt;I don’t believe in you&lt;/em&gt;. But I’ve never had a problem with believing in things, and thank god I didn’t. Have you ever heard about self-fulfilling prophecies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: No, I haven’t. But it sounds like you have a story behind this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, as a matter of fact, I do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my A-levels, my psychology teacher Mr. Loo taught us about something called the &lt;em&gt;self-fulfilling prophecy&lt;/em&gt;. We read a case study about this experiment where a group of 100 students was split randomly into two classes of 50. They told the students that one of the (arbitrarily chosen) classes was the ‘better’ class and that the other class was the ‘weaker’ class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, things went on as usual. Both classes had the same lessons, taught by the same teachers, and used the same facilities - there was no actual difference between the two classes except for the arbitrary ‘better’ or ‘weaker’ labels assigned to them at the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study went on for some time, like maybe a year or so, the students sat for their exams, and then finally it was results day. The students obtained their exam results, and the researchers obtained their experiment results. You can see where this is going - I can’t remember the exact details, but between the two classes, the class labeled ‘better’ had obtained significantly better examination results than the ‘weaker’ class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first heard this story, I was shocked. I couldn’t believe that an entire class of students did better, or worse, simply because they were told at the beginning that they were so. But the more I thought about it, the more it made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I couldn’t believe that an entire class of students did better, or worse, simply because they were told at the beginning that they were so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The labels, although arbitrary, were far from harmless. You tell a kid that he’s a weaker student than that other kid, he’s going to believe it. And as a consequence of that belief, he expects there to be a glass ceiling above his head, limiting how high he can reach - so he doesn’t stretch himself that far. In a community, this is even more destructive. His teachers expect the class to be less capable, so they give them less advanced material, fewer rewards. The parents are disappointed that their child didn’t make the better class, and the disappointment bleeds through to the kid, who may have been working hard all along but becomes frustrated and stops believing in the effectiveness of his hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding all of this, the label becomes so much more powerful than just a label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It becomes a prophecy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Wow. Given what you’ve just told me about self-fulfilling prophecies, it seems incredibly important to not listen to the naysayers, isn’t that right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly! In the face of everyone trying to place different labels on you, you have to choose which labels you want to believe in. Because that belief ultimately turns into actions, which turns into results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why if I have a choice of which prophecies I want to believe in, I choose to be relentlessly optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
