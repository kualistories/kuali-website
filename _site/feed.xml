        <title>Going Off the Deep End</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of university are very different from high school. In high school or college, there was a defined set of targets and expectations put forward by others, for instance scoring well in school exams, looking for scholarship opportunities, entering a good university etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In university, you are on your own. You are responsible for every decision you make and every decision you make might decide who you are and what you do in the very near future. One major difference I noticed lies in the absence of short-term goals like what you would have during high school. You know you have to do something but what? How? I felt lost and perhaps depressed, to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kualistories.github.io/img/Lost1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lost&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first entered university, I actually felt that the language and culture barrier was a factor that hindered social mingling, which was quite surprising to me. I assumed that it would go okay but I found it a bit challenging to mingle with the locals. To be frank, I found the local accent quite hard to understand; I connected better with international students and we knew how each other felt, since we were all trying our best to communicate and learn together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the language and cultural barriers, I struggled a little in making deeper connections with people, even though I had no problem doing so back in Malaysia, but it did get better eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously I also felt lost as I was questioning what was the point of studying so hard in university. “What’s the next step?” I wondered, especially since I could see the end of university coming soon, and with that, there was a need to “step into society” and do something worthwhile as a career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Due to the language and cultural barriers, I struggled a little in making deeper connections with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my second and third year, I felt a lot more comfortable. I eventually started some projects and a business of my own, which was quite ironic as I used to hate business. The financial pressure as a result of my business, the amount of workload from both study and work as well as personal health issues made me feel quite down in the dumps at a certain point. Some would say “depressed” although I’m not really sure if the symptoms fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this was the path I chose and I never regretted it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Entrepreneurship from Scratch</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my second and third year, I started a few projects as well as some business endeavors. It was a tremendously exhausting journey but surprisingly I felt much better than I was in first year.  I found a path and a purpose, though it might not be the easiest path to walk on. I might trip or fall a lot but even if I do, I am moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might say university is “useless” because in many cases, what you study will probably have nothing to do with what you do in the future. Personally, I think that university is the perfect ground for you to build connections with amazing people all around the world and the perfect ground to fail. Yes, fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a university student, you do not have as many responsibilities and expectations than you would have as a working adult but you have more freedom and help. You can afford to fail and start over - an inevitable yet crucial process that builds you up to your eventual success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, you have an easy access to a network of professionals literally right at your doorstep! Professors and lecturers are generally always willing to help you if they can with free advice if you go up to them for a chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you elaborate more on the business that you started? I think it’d be helpful to give a glimpse at what is possible for them to accomplish even during their uni studying period.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started a social enterprise with my business partner in Malaysia and recruited a few of my friends to join the team. The essence of a social entrepreneurship is building a business that gives back to the community, which I personally feel quite strongly about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you have no experience and no capital to do stuff, you need to get them yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very rough in the beginning, especially when looking for investments or partnerships, as no one wants to support a company with no proven track record. When you have no experience and no capital to do stuff, you need to get them yourself. You need to build the experience and if it is possible, use that experience to build your capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my entire three years at university, I never traveled outside of London - except Brighton and Malaysia, if that counts! Instead, I spent my time building new skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kualistories.github.io/img/Startup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;startup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From scratch, I studied graphic design, digital marketing, and business, realms that I never ventured into before and never thought I would prior to my startup project. After a while, I started marketing my skills to international clients via various online platforms and begin building my client base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that period, I slept only 5 hours a day and had a ton of caffeine - not really advisable for a uni student! Nevertheless, I survived, and although the project didn’t manage to launch in the end (we put it on hold as we weren’t satisfied with the final quality of the products), we definitely learned a lot from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have just launched another company with my partner, offering digital services to both local and international clients.  We hope that through this company we could eventually build up a core team that we trust as well as sufficient capital so that we could revisit our initial idea in the very near future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Depression at University</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kualistories.github.io/img/Depression.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;depression&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that I noticed in Imperial is that depressed people tend to be quite evasive regarding their issues and are reluctant to admit they’re in trouble. In particular, people don’t want others to pity them and that contributes to the idea that depression is ‘taboo’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, from what I’ve seen, a lot of Imperial students suffer from it; what matters is how you handle it. People are often more than willing to help you, they do have similar feelings and can give you mental support if you need it. So don’t be afraid to voice out if you need help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when you do open up to someone else, they might not take it seriously as they don’t see the depth of how affected you are by it due to the mask that you put on daily, and the fact that you seem so ‘normal’. If you don’t feel comfortable talking with friends who may not know how to respond, Imperial health services do offer good professional counseling to those who need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Malaysian scholars, in particular, have very high expectations of themselves and being at a top university doesn’t really help matters! Here you’re surrounded by top-tier talent from all around the world, so if you fail at anything it hits you really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d say to always prepare yourself for failure; things don’t always turn out the way you want them to and that’s alright, you shouldn’t beat yourself up over it. Learn and salvage as much as possible from your mistake. Don’t dwell on it, work on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;editors-note&quot;&gt;
Editor’s Note: Depression is a serious and complicated illness, and we would like to point out that depression can take many forms; experiences and symptoms stated here might differ with the experience of others that are experiencing depression, and the coping mechanisms that may work for one may not work as well for another person.

        <title>[FULL] Conversations with Wee Rock</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you say to your pre-uni self?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teaching Quality at Imperial</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the academic field, rankings aren’t exactly synonymous with teaching quality. Imperial is amazing in terms of rankings, but in my opinion, the high rank comes mainly from the research and some of the teaching is honestly a bit subpar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t expect spoon-feeding, after all, it is the student’s responsibility to learn; I just think that certain members of the teaching staff could spend more energy connecting with students and presenting their knowledge with more passion. In my course, some of the students do indeed complain about the lecturers, and it’s not just a particular subset or even Malaysian mindset but it’s sort of agreed that we could have better teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their motivations for teaching are quite varied I’m sure, and I’m sure that a few of them likely wouldn’t even go into teaching if they were given a choice. In retrospect, I definitely gave a lot of educators some flak they didn’t deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Studying the Wrong Course?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After coming out from university I feel like I chose the wrong course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kualistories.github.io/img/Study.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Study&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out that I’m interested in Biology and Chemistry but those aren’t things I’m going to pursue as a career. In Biotechnology everything I learned is microscopic (for example, we learn about &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; and mosquito proteins and their inner workings/structural stuff) but my interest lies more towards bigger, more macro-level stuff on the scale of tissues and organs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think the right course for me would have been biomedical science; I probably wouldn’t have been happier (the workload is crazy!) but I would definitely have liked what I studied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why didn’t you apply for that in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well for one I didn’t really realize how micro-focused the contents of the Biotechnology course was; another factor is that in the sixth form college I went to, Biomedical science is in a way the ‘dirty’ course in the sense that it is regarded as the course medicine rejects go to. Hence Biotech it was!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have any major regrets about taking the course but it would be helpful to have that knowledge before starting the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a difference between feeling the course is wrong for you and the course actually being really wrong for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s important for pre-uni students to know that just because you don’t feel comfortable studying a particular course, it doesn’t mean it is the wrong move for you; there is a difference between feeling the course is wrong for you and the course actually being really wrong for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though a few of our current batch applied to Oxbridge and got rejected, some of us have discussed it and agreed that although Oxbridge are really esteemed places of learning, in London you get an education more focused on networking potential alongside your study life, which really contributes to you having more contacts in various areas. Your network is your net worth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my misgivings I’m currently fairly satisfied as I feel in control of the path I am on, I am choosing where I am going. In university, I chose to invest in MNight (Malaysian Night) and other extracurricular activities and those were where I excelled in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Network = Networth</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It really does not matter which university you go to, it’s the extracurricular activities and the people you meet with that determines the worth of your time spent there. The course is merely a channel to feed you information; I believe exams do not really teach me anything as its main role is to make me take the course seriously and connect people to the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kualistories.github.io/img/Network.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Network&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could go to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) or to Oxford or Cambridge but if you end up disinterested in the course while simultaneously not trying any new activities, you will only end up achieving less than if you had gone to a lesser-ranked uni and taken part in lots of extracurricular activities to broaden your horizons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you are connected with two friends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is a very creative and proactive person; he really pushes himself to create things and has his own network of ‘makers’; by being friends with him you get the opportunity to hear about awesome things his friends are making and maybe even learn something new!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another friend is a very friendly, outgoing person who volunteers a lot in her spare time. She likely has a network of contacts throughout say, education due to her experience volunteering there, and by being friends with her you also get access to her contacts in case you want to enter the field in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately for me, I have no regrets coming to London due to the network I have built up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The main thing I have to say is that MNight is great but it WILL take up a lot of your time, and you need to be conscious of the pros and cons of joining it. MNight serves as an excellent entry point to learning and embodying &lt;em&gt;what it means to be Malaysian&lt;/em&gt; and shows the world what Malaysians have to offer in terms of what we stand for and what talents we have to offer (and boy do we see a lot of talent on display!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kualistories.github.io/img/Malaysian.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Malaysian&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, however, something that doesn’t come up often about MNight is that involving yourself too heavily in it will effectively close the door off to many things you can do in terms of exploring other interests outside the Malaysian bubble (skydiving, mountaineering, and other sports, to name a few).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I would highly recommend it if you’re looking to develop a wide range of skills and especially your network; however, I think it’s worth considering joining in the first year and perhaps taking the second year to explore your options elsewhere, getting out of your comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an alumnus’ perspective, however, we definitely encourage you to come help out if you feel like you might want to give it a shot, as we definitely need brilliant people to helm various positions (choreographers, committee members, ushers and etc.) to help out the next batch of first years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people have commented that Imperial’s MNight, in particular is somewhat different in terms of content, with a lot of emphasis on themes and settings more often portrayed in mainstream media as opposed to more culturally accurate settings for example. Would you say that’s true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I think that is one way of putting it; Imperial’s MNight has always tried to keep our content original, engaging and universal, and places a heavy emphasis on showcasing our greatest resource: talent. We also try to insert universal themes featuring more universal and ‘primal’ emotions such as love, romance, betrayal and friendship as well as interesting plot twists to keep it relatable for the international crowd, which I’m quite glad to say Imperial does a good job of attracting every year so everyone can enjoy the play! I think it’s a great way of representing spirit, cultural idiosyncrasies, and traditions; would definitely recommend you giving it a try!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Join MNight lah!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you had to sell MNight to a potential fresher in a few sentences, what would you say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I begin, I would like to preface this by saying that although some points can apply to MNights across the United Kingdom, I primarily refer to the Imperial experience of MNight as this is what I have experienced.  Other universities likely have different scales and individual experiences unique to their performances. Okay, on to business!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, you can train a boatload of skills (time management, leadership, discipline to name a few of the common ones) just via ONE event, especially if you intend to become a choreographer. It looks great on your CV and you WILL get a chance to expand on existing skills and learn new ones. Some of the previous Malaysians found they could sing and act during MNight; you also get to try new things like ballroom dancing alongside your Malaysian friends, in a non-judgemental and somewhat familiar setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kualistories.github.io/img/Dance.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, you get the chance to showcase Malaysian talent on a global platform. I personally feel Imperial does a great job of being internationally friendly as our themes are very relatable across borders. When you’re on the stage, you’re not only representing yourself but also Msoc (to the other societies), Imperial (to the other unis) and most importantly Malaysia (to the world!) You’re essentially a window or a gateway into Malaysia, and when Imperial graduates talk about university this performance is likely something they’ll still remember after they graduate, so you definitely can achieve an impact. These 2 nights alone can shape the impressions of 1200 people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;MSoc (Malaysian society) is basically a ready-made friendship circle for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly and finally, you get to meet a whole lot of different people in a very easy way. MSoc (Malaysian society) is basically a ready-made friendship circle for you; learning new activities together has been proven to be a really effective way to bond and get new friends in a new environment, which can help you find your footing when you first arrive here in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, here in Imperial, you will find that we really emphasize a high quality of production; this culture of wanting to be the best can and will propel you to achieve more than you would think possible. Your seniors and your seniors’ seniors have experienced and put on their own high-quality performances and will push you to your very limits; so it is definitely a tough but worthy endeavor to involve yourselves in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Find Your Passion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some students are saying it is hard to pursue their passions as they do not know what they are passionate about yet; not only in terms of MNight but in general as well. How would you advise them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, maintain a high throughput system (within legal bounds of course!) which means try as many things as possible. As you try new things, your brain absorbs new experiences and they enrich your mind, enabling you to gain new perspectives on the world and the things in it. Almost certainly, this will lead to you finding something that you are uniquely suited for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kualistories.github.io/img/Film.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Film&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it is movies and film in general; I’m actually taking some online courses on the history of film and am planning to go to film school in the future, not because I want to break into the industry or anything (it is quite hard to break into it as a newcomer) but because I want to further my skills and appreciate the field better. These passions developed during my college years when I was watching the Oscars and slowly started to realize how movies and film have shaped our society and public perception; over time this gradually developed more and more till where I am today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I would advise any pre-university students to try lots of different things and spark your interest. Some examples are playing the badminton, painting, playing the violin, photography and etc. You may find yourself doing better than other people in certain things, and maybe you could try turning it into something beneficial for society like writing book reviews or even side projects as a part-time pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Choose your battles wisely and always grow yourself, only then can you mature and continually grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that sometimes you will end up doing two things at once: one as a source of income and one to keep your passion going. Choose your battles wisely and always grow yourself, only then can you mature and continually grow.&lt;/p&gt;
